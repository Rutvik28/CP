# INTRODUCTION

This repo contains solutions to various programming problems available online, most of them coded in `C++`.
It also has a few template files related to specific algorithms or data structure.

Each solution file is appended with a `commented` section on top. It consists of:
- Tags
- Problem description and/or link
- Runtime complexity

## TAGS

Every solution file starts with one or more tags representing the algorithm/data structure used to solve the problem. These tags can also be used to find other related problems. Here is a complete list of tags used in this repo:

Topic | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
**GRAPH:** | `_bfs` | `_01bfs` | `_dij` | `_MST` | `_floyd_warshall`
**TREE:** | `_dfs` | `_tree_flatten` | `_ancestor` | `_LCA` | `_euler_path`
**STRING:** | `_kmp` | `_prefix_array` | `_hashing` |  | 
**RANGE:** | `_lazy` | `_segment_tree` | `_RMQ` | `_BIT` | 
**STRUCTS:** | `_DSU` | `_policy_tree` | `_direction` | `_bitset` | `_offline`
**ALGOS:** | `_MO` | `_sqrt_decomp` | `_grundy` | `_HLD` | `_fast_matrix_multiply`
  | `_DP` | `_recursion` | `_nCr` | `_sieve` | `_prime_factorize`
  | `_cycle` | `_line_sweep` | `_subarray` | `_bitmask` | `inclusion_exclusion`
