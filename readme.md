# INTRODUCTION

This repo contains solutions to various programming problems available online, most of them coded in `C++`.
It also has a few template files related to specific algorithms or data structure.

Each solution file is appended with a `commented` section on top. It consists of:
- Tags
- Problem description and/or link
- Runtime complexity

##TAGS

Every solution file starts with one or more tags representing the algorithm/data structure used to solve the problem. These tags can also be used to find other related problems. Here is a complete list of tags used in this repo:
