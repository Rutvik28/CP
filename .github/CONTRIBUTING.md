# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Steps before creating a Pull request

1. Please ensure that the code has a comment-block at the top following these norms:
   * First line contains [tags][tags overview] relevant to the particular problem. You can find 
     the list of available tags [here][all tags]
   * Next few lines (optional) has a brief explanation of your approach and/or link to the problem
   * Last line mentions the [runtime complexity][run] of your code
2. Please try to write clean and indented code. Sparsely occuring concise comments are also fine
   but not mandatory.
3. Ensure that the problem is correctly categorised in one of the [Online Judges][judges]. If 
   none of the existing judges qualify, create a new directory or push it in **others** directory.
4. Please follow these rules in the commit message:
   * Try to mention contest code if the problem belongs to some contest
   * Please use [this link][emojis] and insert some emoji :stuck_out_tongue: of your choice with 
     the commit message
